    "Use a deep learning algorithm (for example, convolutional neural networks, recurring neural networks) to solve one of the problems we already discussed in class (my recommendation would be to re-do the morphology classification of galaxies using the full data set which is available on Kaggle, the link is in WS7). This will require installing and using TensorFlow/Keras and playing around with tutorials/examples; this work should be included in the report and will be graded as part of the project."
